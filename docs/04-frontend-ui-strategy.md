# Frontend UI Strategy

## Overview

Noterer's frontend is designed to provide an intuitive user experience for note-taking, AI interaction, and graph navigation. This document outlines our UI design principles, component architecture, and interaction patterns.

## Design Philosophy

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Clean, uncluttered interface
   - Focus on content creation and AI interaction
   - Progressive disclosure of advanced features

2. **Content-Centric**
   - Note content is the primary focus
   - Contextual actions appear when relevant
   - Minimal chrome and distractions

3. **Thoughtful AI Integration**
   - AI features enhance rather than overwhelm
   - Clear distinction between user content and AI contributions
   - Transparent AI processing with appropriate feedback

## Component Descriptions

### Main Window

The main window provides the overall application layout with three primary sections:

1. **Sidebar**
   - List of recent notes with previews
   - Search functionality
   - Filtering and sorting options
   - Creation date and concept indicators

2. **Content Area**
   - Primary note editing interface
   - Rich text formatting
   - Inline concept highlighting
   - Save/edit controls

3. **AI Interaction Panel**
   - Query input for asking the AI
   - Response display area
   - Processing indicators
   - Context visibility

### Note Editor

The note editor is the primary interface for content creation:

1. **Core Features**
   - Rich text editing (formatting, links, lists)
   - Auto-saving
   - Version history
   - Distraction-free mode

2. **AI Enhancements**
   - Real-time concept highlighting
   - Suggested connections to existing notes
   - Category indicators
   - Contextual AI assistance

### Graph View (Future Implementation)

The graph view will provide visual navigation of the knowledge graph:

1. **Visualization Options**
   - Force-directed graph layout
   - Hierarchical concept view
   - Timeline view
   - Category-based clustering

2. **Interaction Patterns**
   - Zoom and pan navigation
   - Node selection and expansion
   - Filtering by category or relationship type
   - Search within graph

## Interaction Patterns

### Note Creation and Editing

```
User Flow:
1. Click "New Note" or keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+N)
2. Enter note content in editor
3. Note automatically saved as draft
4. AI processes note in background, extracting concepts
5. Concepts highlighted in editor with subtle visual cues
6. User can click on concept to see related notes/concepts
7. User can manually trigger full AI processing
8. Save explicitly to finalize note
```

### AI Interaction

```
User Flow:
1. Enter query in AI panel input field
2. AI retrieves context from current note and knowledge graph
3. Progress indicator shows processing
4. Response displayed with source citations
5. Concepts in response are interactive
6. User can add AI response to note
7. User can ask follow-up questions
```

### Graph Navigation (Future)

```
User Flow:
1. Open graph view from note
2. Note appears as central node with connections
3. Click on related nodes to navigate
4. Filter view by category or relationship type
5. Search for specific nodes
6. Select node to open in editor
```

## UI Implementation

### Technology Stack

1. **CustomTkinter**
   - Modern themed Tkinter widgets
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Native desktop performance

2. **UI Components**
   - Custom widget development for specialized components
   - Responsive layout management
   - Theme support (light/dark modes)

3. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard shortcuts for all actions
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Configurable font sizes and colors

### UI Architecture Pattern

The frontend follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

1. **Model**
   - Data structures representing notes, concepts, etc.
   - API client for backend communication
   - Local state management

2. **View**
   - UI components for rendering data
   - Pure presentation logic
   - Theme implementation

3. **Controller**
   - Event handling
   - Business logic
   - Coordination between view and model

## Responsive Design

While initially a desktop application, the UI is designed with responsive principles:

1. **Layout Adaptability**
   - Resizable windows and panes
   - Collapsible sidebar
   - Adjustable font sizes

2. **Mobile Considerations** (for future web/mobile versions)
   - Touch-friendly target sizes
   - Simplified mobile layouts
   - Gesture support

## Performance Optimization

1. **UI Responsiveness**
   - Asynchronous API communication
   - Background processing for AI operations
   - Pagination for large datasets

2. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Virtualized lists for large note collections
   - Lazy loading of content
   - Efficient graph rendering

## Theme System

The UI supports theming with:

1. **Base Themes**
   - Light mode (default)
   - Dark mode
   - System preference detection

2. **Customization Options**
   - Accent color selection
   - Font family and size
   - Element spacing

3. **Implementation**
   - CSS-like theme variables
   - Theme switching without restart
   - Per-component theme application

## Future UI Enhancements

1. **Advanced Editing**
   - Markdown support
   - Code block syntax highlighting
   - Image and media embedding

2. **Collaboration Features**
   - Multiple user support
   - Comment threads
   - Change tracking

3. **Visualization Enhancements**
   - Interactive concept maps
   - Relationship strength visualization
   - Temporal view of note evolution

4. **Alternative Interfaces**
   - Web application
   - Mobile companion app
   - Voice interface for note capture
