# Noterer Architecture Strategy

## Overview

Noterer follows a decoupled architecture that clearly separates the backend from the frontend. This document outlines the architectural decisions, component interactions, and the reasoning behind this approach.

## Core Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Backend and frontend are completely decoupled
   - Each component has a clear, single responsibility
   - Interactions happen through well-defined APIs

2. **Microservices-Inspired Design**
   - Backend is organized into logical service components
   - Each service handles a specific domain (AI, database, note processing)
   - Components communicate through dependency injection

3. **Scalability & Flexibility**
   - API-driven design allows for alternative frontends
   - Asynchronous processing enables responsiveness
   - Stateless service design supports future scaling

## Component Architecture

### Backend Architecture

```
Backend
├── API Layer (FastAPI)
│   ├── Routes
│   └── Models/Schemas
├── Core Business Logic
│   ├── Note Processor
│   ├── Concept Extractor
│   └── Philosophical Categorizer
├── AI Integration
│   ├── AI Manager
│   ├── Prompt Templates
│   └── Response Processors
└── Database Layer
    ├── Graph Manager
    ├── Data Models
    └── Query Templates
```

### Frontend Architecture

```
Frontend
├── Main Application
├── API Client
├── Views (UI Components)
│   ├── Main Window
│   ├── Note Editor
│   └── Graph Visualization
└── Controllers (UI Logic)
```

## Communication Flow

1. **User Interaction Flow**
   - User interacts with frontend UI
   - Frontend controller processes the interaction
   - API client sends requests to backend
   - Backend processes request and returns response
   - Frontend updates UI based on response

2. **Data Flow**
   - Note content flows from frontend to backend
   - AI processes note content
   - Generated concepts and relationships are stored in Neo4j
   - Query results flow back to frontend for display

3. **API Communication**
   - RESTful API endpoints for all operations
   - JSON payload format
   - Typed request/response schemas
   - Asynchronous communication for long-running operations

## Design Decisions

### Why Decoupled Architecture?

The decoupled architecture was chosen to allow for:
- Independent development of frontend and backend
- Flexibility to replace the frontend with alternative implementations
- Better testability of individual components
- Future expansion to web or mobile interfaces

### Why FastAPI?

FastAPI was selected for the backend because:
- Built-in support for asynchronous operations
- Automatic API documentation
- Type validation with Pydantic models
- High performance with low overhead

### Why CustomTkinter?

CustomTkinter was chosen for the initial frontend because:
- Modern, customizable UI components
- Desktop application capabilities
- Relatively lightweight
- Tkinter is included with Python

### Why Neo4j?

Neo4j was selected as the database because:
- Native graph data model aligns with philosophical categorization
- Efficient traversal of relationships
- Cypher query language is expressive for graph operations
- Strong support for relationship properties and weights

## Future Architectural Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Potential containerization with Docker
   - Separating services for independent scaling
   - Introducing message queues for asynchronous processing

2. **Alternative Frontends**
   - Web interface using React or Vue.js
   - Mobile application
   - Command-line interface for scripting

3. **Security**
   - API authentication
   - Data encryption
   - User management and access control
